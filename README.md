## dotfiles

My dotfiles re-born.

I [archived](https://github.com/Traap/dotfiles-archived) my old dotfiles because
the repository was bloated.

### bin
I map this directory to my path.

#### bin/xsel
xsel should never be pushed to this repository.  I forgot to add .gitignore.

#### bin/xsel-wsl
This file is copied to xsel on WSL2 (Windoz Subsystem 4 Linux) only machines.
bin/xsel-wsl is a 'hack' to copy and paste between WSL and Windoz using the
system copy paste buffer.

### hack
Setup has various scripts I use to personalize a setup.  These scripts are
designed to run once, or as trouble shooting aids.

## TODO: Update this readme.  It is very stale.
