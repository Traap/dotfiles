### README.md
My personal Waybar configuration.

I borrowed ideas, copied, pasted, hacked, deleted, and modified files from the
acknowledgement section below.  Then I gutted everthing I did not want to use
and made come customizations.  My goal is to have waybar as close a possible to
my polybar configuration.
