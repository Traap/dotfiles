## The Problem:
Windoz always know best.  Therefore, one must override insane default applied to
a WSL2 machine.

I typically modify
- hosts
- resolv.conf
- wsl.conf


## How far have we fallen from WSL1 to WSL2
Windoz demonstrated another brilliant move.  Windoz prevents us from using
DISPLAY. wslTerminator.vbs is a reminder of something that worked to improve a
developers workflow and then Windoz took it way because they know best how I
should use my equipment.
